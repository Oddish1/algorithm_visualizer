# Algorithms Visualizer

This project is a basic visualizer that allows the user to select an algorithm,
scale the number of items or numbers the algorithm will be using, and start the
algorithm. As the algorithm is running, you will be able to see a visual
representation of what is happening on the screen as well as a timer for how
long it takes the algorithm to run.
